WebGL builds can be published on a website, on Unity Play, or on a platform such as itch.io.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
